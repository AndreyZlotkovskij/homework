            <p id="main">The Maserati MC20 (MC being the acronym for Maserati Corse 2020, internal code M240) is a two-seater, rear-mid-engine sports car produced by Italian car manufacturer Maserati.

                The debut of the MC20 was initially scheduled for May 2020,
                but was rescheduled along with brand redesign for September 2020 in Modena.
                A racing variant was also announced at the same time.
                The open top variant of the MC20 called the Cielo (Italian for sky) made its debut in May 2022.
                The car was developed by the Maserati Innovation Lab with an all-electric option slated to reach production in the future.
                The new sports car is produced at the Maserati Modena plant that is undergoing necessary modernization.
                The new car's logo appeared on a Maserati-sponsored Multi 70 trimaran's mainsail that was due to race in the RORC Caribbean 600.
